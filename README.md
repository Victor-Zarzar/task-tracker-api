make up-dev       # Start development server on port 8000
make down-dev     # Stop development server
make logs-dev     # View development logs
make test         # Run tests with pytest
```

### Production

```bash
make up-prod      # Start production environment
make down-prod    # Stop production environment  
make logs-prod    # View production logs
```

## Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ app/                      # Application code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                    # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.dev.yaml   # Development configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.prod.yaml  # Production configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile                   # Task automation
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # This file

## Notes

- Development environment runs with hot reload enabled
- Production environment runs in detached mode with optimized settings
- Use `make help` to see all available commands with descriptions
